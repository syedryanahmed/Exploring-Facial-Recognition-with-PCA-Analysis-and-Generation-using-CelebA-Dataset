# Facial Feature Extraction and Generation via Principal Component Analysis on CelebA Dataset

This project explores the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for facial feature extraction and generation using the CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) dataset.

## Overview

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to extract the most informative features from high-dimensional data. In this project, PCA is employed to analyze and manipulate facial images from the CelebA dataset, enabling efficient representation, reconstruction, and generation of faces.

## Features

- **Data Preparation**: Preprocessing the CelebA dataset by resizing, converting to grayscale, and transforming facial images into numerical vectors.
- **PCA Analysis**: Performing PCA on the preprocessed facial data to identify the principal components that capture the maximum variance among faces.
- **Face Reconstruction**: Projecting facial vectors onto a lower-dimensional space spanned by the top principal components, and reconstructing the original faces to analyze the impact of dimensionality reduction on reconstruction quality.
- **Face Generation**: Generating new facial images by manipulating the principal components within a controlled range and projecting the resulting vectors back into the original data space.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the reconstruction accuracy using metrics like mean squared error, and evaluating the quality and realism of the generated facial images.
